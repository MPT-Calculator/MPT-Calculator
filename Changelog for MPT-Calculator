Changelog for MPT-Calculator:

- main.py:
	- Refactored main.py to be a function with common arguments (order, alpha, geometry ect) being added as variable input arguments. The motivation behind this was to make flow control easier, e.g. looping through different orders.
	- Added occ geometry generation and saving.
	- Added return for TensorArray, EigenValues, N0, elements, Array, ndofs, and EddyCurrentTest. This is to make using these parameters easier for an end user who may wish to use them elsewhere.

- MeshCreation.py:
	- Added function Generate_From_Python(OCC_file) for use when using the OCC geometry. Includes dependency on the standard library runpy.

- ResultsFunctions.py:
	- Added option to FolderMaker for saving .py file when using OCC.

- SingleSolve.py:
	- Fixed bug in calculation of N0.

- PODSolvers.py:
	- Fixed bug in calculation of N0.
	- Added force manual close of parallel pool.
	- Changed pool initialisation from fork to spawn in PODSweepMulti. This was to attempt to fix a bug where the program would stall in multiprocessing on linux.
	- To enable changing pool initialisation, I've use multiprocessing.
