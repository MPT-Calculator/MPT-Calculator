    "The accuracy of the computed MPT coefficients depend on the discretisation used to discretise the transmission problem for ${\\boldsymbol \\theta}_i^{(0)}$ and ${\\boldsymbol \\theta}_i^{(1)}$, which in turn are used to compute the MPT coefficients. The accuracy of the solution depends on the order of the elements and the size and distribution of the tetrahedra in the mesh. To ensure that the solution is accurate, we refine the discretisation until convergence of the solution is achieved.\n",

We have this using not only curved elements (this is achieved by controlling maxh for the spacing around the sphere in the $\\texttt{sphere.geo}$ file, here the file sets maxh=0.2 for the inner sphere).

    "We observe that the $p$ refinement leads to an exponential convergence of the MPT coefficients to the exact solution, while $h$ refinement leads to only an algebraic rate of convergence. Furthermore, for very coarse meshes, $h$-refinement may show a pre-asymptotic behavior where the convergence may at first be quick before slowing down to a constant rate. On the other hand, provided that the geometry is sufficiently well resolved, then the rate of converges improves as $p$ is increased (in practice this will always be limited by the geometry resolution). This means that for a given fixed number of degrees of freedom (NDOF), using $p$ refinement gives a more accurate solution compared to the corresponding solution with $h$ refinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, given the improved accuracy with $p$ refinement, we recommend using this over $h$ refinement. For objects with sharp edges and/or strong material discontinuities or high $\\mu_r$, it may also beneficial to use local $h$ refinement (or boundary layer elements in the case of high $\\mu_r$) to supplement using $p$ refinement. Further details of this are provided in subsequent tutorials."
