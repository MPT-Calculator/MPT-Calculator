    James Elgy - 2024.
    Function to compute the real tensor coefficients (R)_ij efficiently using the faster matrix method.
    
    1) Computes the bilinear form K
    2) If reduced solve is True, reduce K to size MxM
    3) For each frequency, compute conj(q_i)^T Q_ij (q_j)
    4) Scale and compute (R)_ij
    
    If BigProblem is True, then a slower but more memory efficient implementation is used using K.Apply().
    
    Args:
        bilinear_bonus_int_order (int): Integration order for the bilinear forms
        fes2 (comp.HCurl): HCurl finite element space for the Theta1 problem.
        inout (fem.CoefficientFunction): material coefficient function. 1 inside objects, 0 outside
        mu_inv (comp.GridFunction): grid function for 1/mu_r. Note that for material discontinuities aligning with vertices no interpolation is done.
        alpha (float): object size scaling
        Sols (np.ndarray): Ndof x nfreqs x 3 vector of solution coefficients.
        u1Truncated (_type_): Ndof x M complex left singular matrix for e_1. If ReducedSolve is False, then replace U with sparse identity of size Ndof.
        u2Truncated (_type_): Ndof x M complex left singular mactrix for e_2. If ReducedSolve is False, then replace U with sparse identity of size Ndof.
        u3Truncated (_type_): Ndof x M complex left singular matrix for e_3. If ReducedSolve is False, then replace U with sparse identity of size Ndof.
        NumSolverThreads (int | str): Multithreading threads. If using all threads use 'default'.
        drop_tol (float | None): During assembly entries < drop_tol are assumed to be 0. Use None to include all entries.
        BigProblem (bool): if True then the code does not assemble the system matrix entirely. Slower but more memory efficient.
        ReducedSolve (bool, optional): If True, the size of the multiplications are reduced to size M. Use with POD. Defaults to True.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: Nfreq x 9 array of real tensor coeffcients.
